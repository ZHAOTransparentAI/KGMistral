Each read has a unique identifier (ID), which allows it to be tracked throughout the alignment process.\\n2. Quality Scores: These are numerical values assigned to each base call in a read, indicating how confident the sequencing instrument is in calling that particular nucleotide. Higher quality scores indicate greater confidence in the call.\\n3. Mapping Information: This includes the start and end positions of each read within the reference genome, as well as any gaps or insertions present in the alignment.\\n4. Metadata: Additional information about the reads, such as their source, library preparation method, and sequencing platform, can also be stored in the BAM file.\\n5. Index Files: These are separate files that allow for fast searching and retrieval of specific reads or regions of interest within the main BAM file.
